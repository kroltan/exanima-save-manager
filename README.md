# Exanima Save Manager

This tool backs up Exanima save files (both campaign and Arena)
and settings into profiles, which can be restored later.

## Download

Head over to the [releases](https://github.com/kroltan/exanima-save-manager/releases/)
page and grab the latest executable, or if you are technically
inclined, download the source and compile it.

Save it anywhere you want and double click it to open.

## Usage

When you open the program, you will see a list of profiles
(which will be empty if you never used it before), and a
couple buttons:

So hit the "New" button, type in a name for your profile and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

Now, bear in mind that creating a profile does not backup automatically,
so select the profile in the list and click "Save". When you want
to restore that state, select it and click "Load".

**For best effect, exit the game before saving a profile, to guarantee
the save is exactly where you stopped.**
